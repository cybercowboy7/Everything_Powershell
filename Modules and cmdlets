What are modules:
  - Groups of related PowerShell capabilities that are bundled together into a single unit.
  - Can check list of available modules by running: Get-Module -ListAvailable

How to use them:
  - In order to use module's cmdlets, the module must be loaded using the Import-Module cmdlet

Finding cmdlets in PowerShell:
  - Get-Command: retrieves information about a command
  - Get-Help

Using Modules to discover cmdlets:
  - Get-Module command will display a partial list of cmdlets that the module you reference contains
  - Get-Command -Module NetAdapter ----> restricts the results to just the commands in the designated module

PowerShell Gallery:
  - Uses PowerShellGet
  - Find-Command cmdlet searches for commands, function, aliases etc.

Get-Alias:
  - Can use this cmdlet to discover new cmdelts
  - Can use the New-Alias cmdlet to create a custom alias that you can map to any existing cmdlet. These are not saved between PowerShell sessions


Use Show-Command and Get-Help in PowerShell:
  - Show-Command opens a window that displays either a list of commands or a specific command's parameters
  - To display a specific commands parameters, provide the name of the command as the value for the -Name parameter.
    - Example: Show-Command -Name Get-ADUser
